# leaflet-challenge

I will be honest, I forgot we had this with the project going on. I managed to power through it, though there was a lot of frustration at times. A slight typo meant I could not get the circles to load properly for a while.

Anyway, eventually I was able to figure that out, and after that the only real challenge was the legend. It was a struggle to figure out how to include it, especially in the format of the example image.
